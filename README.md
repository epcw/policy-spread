Note: This can also be run on a WordPress site either within the WP framework of a post or page (more complicated as you have to point to the script files and WP doesn't really play nice with JSONs, delete the index.html file) or create your own directory (such as ~/apps/wordpress/htdocs/policy-spread/) and dump everything in there (easier, your page will be the contents of the index.html file)
